*******************************************************************************************************************
951029:
	- Inputs are assumed merely active low, code is written accordingly.


*******************************************************************************************************************
951030:
	- Program tick and DAC both now use timer1/counter1.

*******************************************************************************************************************

951103:
	- Bug removed
	   - The noisy sound in the oputput was get rid off by shortening the program.

*******************************************************************************************************************

951103:
	- Board is modified to work with musics of 16kHz sampling rate (rather than 32kHz)
	   - Music must be generated using the Matlab interface (which would produce music with 16kHz sampling rate).
	   - Function Flash_Page_Read() now reads half a page of AT45DB (rather than the entire page). Music is upsampled in this function as well.
	   - Page tick is shortened again, it is now 450*1/(32kHz).
	   - Extra album one and two are now defined in the Music_Pages.h.
	   - Push buttons are modified so that if held together, album changes (no LED is used any further for changing album)	


*******************************************************************************************************************

951124:
	- Trigger signal is given a higher priority compared to OVL and DOB signals. This way 
	  if DOB or OVL comes while the elevator is in trigger mode, the signals are ignored.
	   - The corresponding don't care bits in General.h, the definition of input signal detection function are
	     also modified.	

*******************************************************************************************************************

951125:
	- ALB Mode port has been removed, emergency signal is now read from PC2.

*******************************************************************************************************************

951128:
	- Lots of globals are now defined as local variables to Main.cpp in Main.h
	- Bug removed:
	   - All the if loops in Floor_Finder() are removed, no need to check for FLOOR state in this function.
	   - floor_elevation_flag is only set when there is a change in floor number, otherwise it may be zero in many unwanted situations. 

*******************************************************************************************************************

951203:
	- Location of each message and music in the flash memory is now derived from the corresponding bytes in the first page of flash.
	  Function Page_Extraction() reads the first page of AT45DB321E, extracts the bytes of this page, and saves them in E2PROM. The
	  addresses in EEPROM start from 0x04 and ends at 0xA7 (total of 160 bytes).

*******************************************************************************************************************

951208:
	- Test mode is added to the software which allows QC of the board without having to listen to every single sound of the board.

*******************************************************************************************************************

951210:
	- Learn mode is added to the software which allows adapting the input signals to the logical levels of DOB and TRG.

*******************************************************************************************************************

951215:
	- This version is a template software adapted to the hardware of FSB200a.
	  This software should not be used with FSB200b hardware.

*******************************************************************************************************************

951225:
	- Some bugs regarding floor declarations are removed.

*******************************************************************************************************************

950114:
	- IO_Module is separated from the remainder of the software.

*******************************************************************************************************************

950114:
	- I2C is added to the software.
	- FSB300 and FSB310 platforms are detected based on the pull-down resistor at PB0. 


*******************************************************************************************************************

950114:
	- Emergency port in FSB300 is once again back to port C.


*******************************************************************************************************************

950202:
	- For complete use of the 150 files that can be defined on the memory, we need to read 600 bytes from the memory
	  to form the page_address matrix. Reading consecutive pages is enforced in the Page_Address_Extraction() function.


*******************************************************************************************************************

950207:
	- Music ciphering and deciphering is now added to the board.
